# **Understanding Charts in Splunk**

## **Introduction**
This guide covers how to create basic visualizations in Splunk, including time charts, bar charts, pie charts, and single-value panels. These visualizations help analyze data trends and improve decision-making.  

## **Basic Splunk Searches for Charts**
Below are some key searches and how they translate into different chart types.

### **1. Time Chart - Average Bytes Over Time**
```spl
index=web
| timechart avg(bytes) 
```
- **Displays the average number of bytes over time as a line chart.**

### **2. Time Chart - Average Bytes Per Host**
```spl
index=web
| timechart avg(bytes) by host
```
- **Shows the average bytes per web server over time, each represented by a different color-coded line.**

### **3. Bar Chart - Average Bytes Per Host (Static)**
```spl
index=web
| chart avg(bytes) by host
```
- **Displays the total average bytes per host as a static bar chart (not over time).**

### **4. Time Chart - Actions Taken by Users**
```spl
index=web
| where isnotnull(action)
| timechart count by action
```
- **Counts actions taken over time, visualized as a line chart.**  
- **Can be customized with stacking, labels, and legend positioning.**

### **5. Pie Chart - Total Actions Taken**
```spl
index=web
| stats count by action
```
- **Displays a pie chart showing the distribution of different actions taken by users.**

### **6. Single-Value Chart - Total Purchases**
```spl
index=web action=purchase
| stats count
```
- **Shows the total number of purchases as a single-value visualization.**  
- **Color coding can highlight high or low sales performance.**

### **7. Column Chart - What Was Purchased**  
```spl
index=web action=purchase
| lookup productinfo.csv productId OUTPUT description
| where isnotnull(productId)
| chart count over host by description useother=f limit=0
```
- **Shows the number of purchases for each product, grouped by host, in a column chart.**

### **8. Time Chart - Failed Login Attempts**
```spl
index=security eventtype=failed_login
| timechart count by user limit=5 useother=f usenull=f
```
- **Shows the top 5 users with the most failed login attempts over time.**

## **Creating a Dashboard**
You can save these searches as panels in a Splunk **dashboard** for easy access to key insights. Follow these steps:  

1. **Run a search** and adjust visualization settings.  
2. Click **Save As â†’ Dashboard Panel**.  
3. **Name the panel** appropriately (e.g., "Top Failed Logins").  
4. Add it to an existing **"Weekly Info"** dashboard or create a new one.  
5. **Customize** panel layout, colors, and labels for better readability.
